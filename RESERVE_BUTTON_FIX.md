### New ReserveButton Component
Created a dedicated component at `/LibraryApp/src/components/ReserveButton.tsx` that:

- Includes better logging of user interactions
- Uses TouchableOpacity for more reliable touch events

## Testing Steps

1. Open the LibraryApp dashboard
2. Check both "Recommended for You" and "New Books" sections
3. Try reserving a book from each section
4. Verify that:
   - The reserve button works correctly
   - You get appropriate alert messages
   - The book disappears from the list after being reserved
   - Your reservation count updates
   - The book doesn't appear in recommendations anymore

## Technical Notes

- Added consistent styling between sections
- Enhanced debugging information in console logs
- Added explicit type checking for better type safety
