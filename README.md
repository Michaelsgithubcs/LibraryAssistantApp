## üß† Machine Learning Recommendations System

The LibraryApp features a sophisticated recommendation engine powered by multiple machine learning approaches implemented in `recommendation_service.py`:

### Content-Based Filtering
- Analyzes book metadata including titles, authors, genres, and descriptions
- Utilizes TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization from scikit-learn to identify thematic similarities
- Creates feature vectors from combined book metadata (title, author, category, description)
- Calculates cosine similarity between book vectors to find content similarities
- Recommends books with similar content features to those you've previously enjoyed
- Particularly effective for users with specific genre preferences or niche interests

### Collaborative Filtering
- User-based approach identifies readers with similar borrowing and rating patterns
- Calculates similarity between users based on their rating patterns
- Finds books that similar users rated highly (‚â•4) but the target user hasn't read
- Weighs recommendations by both similarity scores and rating values
- Handles sparse data gracefully when users have few common books
- Only recommends books with high ratings from similar users to ensure quality

### Hybrid Recommendation Approach
- Combines both content-based and collaborative filtering techniques for more robust recommendations
- Employs a weighted algorithm (60% collaborative, 40% content-based) to balance between approaches
- Returns detailed book information along with recommendation scores
- Prioritizes books that score highly across both recommendation methods
- Includes fallback mechanisms when either approach has insufficient data
- Returns book details including availability, enabling practical recommendation implementation

## ÔøΩ Security & Privacy

- **User Authentication**: Secure login using email/password with optional biometric authentication
- **Data Encryption**: All sensitive user data and borrowing history is encrypted
- **Privacy Controls**: Users can opt in/out of recommendation features and data collection
- **GDPR Compliant**: Conforms to international data protection standards
