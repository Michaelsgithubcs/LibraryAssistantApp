# ML Recommendation System Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **ML Scores Disappearing After Refreshing**
   - Problem: When pulling to refresh, the recommended books were being reset to random books and ML scores were lost
   - Solution: Modified the refresh function to only update stats, not recommendations

2. **ML Recommendations Resetting After Reserving a Book**
   - Problem: After reserving a book, the app was calling `fetchDashboardData()` which reset recommendations
   - Solution: Modified the reservation flow to only update reservation status, not refresh recommendations

## Changes Made

1. **Modified Dashboard Data Loading**
   ```tsx
   // Only set fallback recommendations if ML recommendations aren't loaded yet
   if (!recommendationsLoaded) {
     // Get random books as fallback recommendations
   } else {
     console.log("ML recommendations already loaded, preserving them");
   }
   ```

2. **Fixed Pull-to-Refresh Function**
   ```tsx
   const onRefresh = async () => {
     // Only update stats, user books and reservations, NOT the recommendations
     const [myBooks, reservations, fines] = await Promise.all([...]);
     
     // Update stats without touching recommendations
     setStats({...});
     
     console.log("Refreshed user data while preserving ML recommendations");
   };
   ```

3. **Fixed Book Reservation Function**
   ```tsx
   // Only update the user's reservations and stats, not the recommendations
   apiClient.getReservationStatus(user.id).then(reservations => {
     setUserReservations(reservations);
     
     // Update stats without refreshing recommendations
     setStats(prevStats => ({...}));
     
     console.log("Updated reservation status without refreshing ML recommendations");
   });
   ```

4. **Improved ML Recommendation Loading**
   ```tsx
   // Set recommended books and explicitly mark as loaded
   setRecommendedBooks(filteredRecs);
   console.log("Setting ML recommendations as loaded");
   setRecommendationsLoaded(true);
   ```

## How to Verify the Fix

1. Launch the app and wait for ML recommendations to load (you'll see ML Score badges)
2. Pull down to refresh the dashboard - ML recommendations and scores should remain unchanged
3. Reserve a book - ML recommendations and scores should remain unchanged
4. Close and reopen the app - ML recommendations should load again with scores

## Technical Details

- Added tracking with `recommendationsLoaded` state to prevent overriding ML recommendations
- Added additional logging to help with debugging
- Separated recommendation loading from general dashboard data loading
- Ensured refresh operations don't reset the ML recommendation state
