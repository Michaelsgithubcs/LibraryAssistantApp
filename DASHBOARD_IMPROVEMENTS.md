# Library App Dashboard Improvements

## Issues Fixed

1. **Reserve Buttons in Dashboard**
   - Fixed the reserve buttons in the recommendation and new books sections
   - Improved book status checking logic to correctly identify reserved/borrowed books
   - Added better error handling and UI feedback

2. **New Books Section**
   - Created a dedicated "New Books" section that shows the most recently added books
   - Added sorting to display newest books first (by publish date or ID)
   - Implemented filtering to exclude books already borrowed or reserved

3. **Recommendation Filtering**
   - Enhanced filtering to ensure books already reserved or borrowed don't appear in recommendations
   - When a book is reserved, it's immediately removed from both recommendation and new books sections
   - Added automatic reload of ML recommendations after reserving a book to maintain the list

4. **UI Responsiveness**
   - Added immediate visual feedback when reserving a book (removed from list instantly)
   - Updated reservation status tracking to provide consistent UI state
   - Implemented better error handling to ensure UI stays responsive

## Key Implementation Details

1. **New Books Handling**
   - Added a separate state array for new books: `const [newBooks, setNewBooks] = useState<Book[]>([])`
   - Created a dedicated `loadNewBooks()` function to fetch and sort books by recency
   - Updated refresh functionality to reload new books without affecting ML recommendations

2. **Reservation System**
   - Modified `handleReserveBook()` to immediately update UI when reserving
   - Added virtual reservation to the local state for immediate feedback
   - Implemented proper filtering to remove reserved books from both lists
   - Added logic to reload ML recommendations after reserving to keep list full

3. **Status Management**
   - Enhanced `getBookStatus()` to accurately track book availability
   - Fixed case sensitivity issues in book title comparisons
   - Improved debugging with better console logging

## How to Test

1. **Reserve Button Testing**
   - Try reserving a book from both recommendations and new books sections
   - Verify the book disappears from the list immediately after reservation
   - Confirm the book status updates in the system

2. **New Books Section**
   - Add a new book through the admin interface
   - Pull to refresh the dashboard
   - Verify the new book appears at the top of the "New Books" section

3. **Filtered Recommendations**
   - Reserve a book and verify it no longer appears in any list
   - Borrow a book and verify it doesn't appear in recommendations
   - Check that ML recommendations are maintained (scores still visible)
