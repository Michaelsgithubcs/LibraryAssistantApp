# Mobile App Fixes Verification Guide

## Changes Made

We've made several important fixes to the mobile app:

1. **Refresh Icon Update**:
   - Replaced the text button with a proper SVG refresh icon
   - Using the refresh.svg from the assets/icons folder
   - Made the icon visually prominent and easy to tap

2. **Already Borrowed Books Filter**:
   - Fixed filtering logic to properly exclude books already borrowed
   - Added double-filtering both by book ID and title
   - Enhanced logging to help diagnose issues

3. **EBooks Network Fix**:
   - Fixed network request issues with the OpenLibrary API
   - Added proper error handling and headers

## How to Verify Changes

### 1. Verify Refresh Icon

1. Open the app and navigate to the Dashboard screen
2. Look at the "Recommended for You" section
3. **What to check**: You should see a circular refresh icon (not text) in the top-right corner
4. **Expected behavior**: The icon should match the refresh.svg from assets

### 2. Verify Already Borrowed Books Filter

1. First, borrow at least 2-3 books via the app
2. Return to the Dashboard
3. Click the refresh icon in the "Recommended for You" section
4. **What to check**: After recommendations load, verify none of your borrowed books appear
5. **Debugging**: Check the console logs which show filtered book IDs and titles

### 3. Verify EBooks Loading

1. Navigate to the EBook Store section of the app
2. The books should load automatically
3. **What to check**: Books should appear without any network errors
4. Try searching for a specific book to verify search works

## Detailed Technical Changes

### Refresh Icon Implementation

We've replaced the text-based refresh button with a proper SVG icon:

```tsx
// Old implementation
<View style={styles.refreshButtonContainer}>
  <Text style={styles.refreshText}>Refresh</Text>
  <Icon name="refresh" ... />
</View>

// New implementation
<TouchableOpacity style={styles.refreshButtonContainer}>
  <RefreshIcon width={24} height={24} ... />
</TouchableOpacity>
```

### Book Filtering Logic

We've enhanced the filtering logic to catch more cases:

```typescript
// New robust filtering
const isAlreadyBorrowed = 
  borrowedBookIds.some(id => id === bookId) || 
  borrowedBookTitles.some(title => 
    bookTitle.includes(title) || title.includes(bookTitle)
  );
```

### Ebooks Network Fix

We've improved the network request for ebooks:

```typescript
const response = await fetch(
  `https://openlibrary.org/search.json?q=${encodeURIComponent(query)}&has_fulltext=true&limit=20`,
  {
    headers: {
      'Accept': 'application/json'
    }
  }
);
```

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. **Refresh button doesn't work**:
   - Check if the refresh icon appears in the UI
   - Verify that touching it calls the fetchMLRecommendations function
   - Look for any console errors

2. **Already borrowed books still showing**:
   - Check the console logs to see which books are being filtered
   - Verify the book IDs match between recommendations and borrowed books
   - Try rebooting the app completely to clear caches

3. **Ebooks still not loading**:
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify if the OpenLibrary API is accessible
   - Try using a different search term
